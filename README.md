# Jev OpenFisca Intake

**Turn a French-language situation into confirmed inputs for an OpenFisca simulation.**

[![Tests](https://github.com/gbesse/jev-openfisca-intake/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gbesse/jev-openfisca-intake/actions/workflows/test.yml) [MIT](LICENSE) · Node.js 22+ · Public alpha

Jev OpenFisca Intake proposes mappings from a user narrative to an explicit variable schema and selects the next useful question. Every inferred value remains unconfirmed until the application or user accepts it.

## Try it in 30 seconds

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gbesse/jev-openfisca-intake.git
cd jev-openfisca-intake
npm install
npm run demo
```

The demo uses synthetic fixture probabilities and makes no network call. They are examples, not measured Jev performance.

## Call real Jev

```sh
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...
node -e "import('./src/jev.mjs').then(({createJevClient}) => console.log(Boolean(createJevClient())))"
```

Real requests are paid and sent to `https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone`. The model is pinned to `jev-1.13.0`, response types and model identity are validated, redirects are rejected, and state above the conservative 24,000-token estimate is refused.

An opt-in `TYPESAFE_API_KEY=... node scripts/live-smoke.mjs` command makes one synthetic request and prints usage. It is never run by CI.

## How it decides

The library keeps identifiers, dates, arithmetic and thresholds in ordinary code. Jev receives only the bounded semantic question shown in [docs/how-it-decides.md](docs/how-it-decides.md). Low-confidence results are marked for review; callers own every resulting action.

## Boundaries

It never computes eligibility or benefits itself, and it does not bundle OpenFisca. Numeric, date and household facts must be validated by code or confirmed by the user.

Jev is strongest in English; French cases need evaluation on representative labels. It can read instructions literally, struggle with negations, dates and arithmetic, and degrade with irrelevant state. This project makes no live quality benchmark claim.

## Validation

`npm run check`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run demo` run locally and in CI on Node.js 22 and 24.
